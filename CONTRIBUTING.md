# Contributing

We are open to and grateful for any contributions. To make the process smooth and effective, please follow these guidelines:

You can follow the installation guide [here](INSTALLATION.md).

## Pull Requests (PRs)

- **Keep it Small:** Break your work into small, manageable PRs to simplify reviews and reduce risks.
- **Branch Naming:** Use topic branches with JIRA task IDs (e.g., `TU-100/branch-description`).
- **Commit Format:** Follow the [semantic-release Commit Message Format](https://github.com/semantic-release/semantic-release#commit-message-format). Ensure PR titles follow the convention: `<type>(JIRA-ID): title`.
- **Rebase, Donâ€™t Merge:** Rebase your branch against `main` before opening a PR and prefer "Rebase and Merge" to keep a clean git history.

## PR Review

- **Complete PR Details:** Provide a clear description of your changes and reasons behind your technical decisions. When applicable, include screenshots or screen recordings to demonstrate the changes visually.
- **Ask for Review:** Request a review on Slack (#create-team channel) with context after your PR passes all checks.

## Merge your PR ðŸŽ‰

Once you have approval from both your team and code owners, it is in **your power** to merge your PR. This approach allows you to coordinate the merge with other projects or repositories and perform a final check on production, ensuring everything is ready before hitting the merge button.

Thank you for your contributions! ðŸŽ‰
